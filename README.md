## About

This open-source developer portfolio template provides a fully functional foundation for building modern, responsive, and visually appealing personal websites. Built with **Vite**, **React**, and **TailwindCSS**, it combines fast development workflows, modular components, and a utility-first styling approach, making it easy to customize and extend. The template includes interactive features such as **tsParticles** for dynamic particle backgrounds, **Typed.js** for animated typewriter-style text effects, and optional **Lottie animations** for smooth vector-based motion, creating an engaging user experience. Pre-configured sections include project showcases, skills visualization, and contact links, along with dark/light mode support. This project serves both as a learning resource for developers exploring modern frontend technologies and as a production-ready foundation for quickly deploying a professional portfolio, demonstrating best practices in structure, responsiveness, and interactive design.
